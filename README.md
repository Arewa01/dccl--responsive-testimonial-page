<h1>Responsive Testimonial</h1>
<p>This is one of my solutions to DevChallenges challenges. The challenge was to build an application to complete the given user stories.</p>
<li>Create a testimonial page that matches the given design.</li>
<li>Use HTML to create the basic structure.</li>
<li>Add heading, body text, checklists according to the design.</li>
<li>Add 2 testimonial cards according to the design.</li>
<li>Use CSS to style the card.</li>
<li>The page should be responsive on different screen sizes.</li>

<p>This was built with html, css and bootstrap</p>
